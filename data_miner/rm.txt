Sample Data Miner in kdb+

Setup and Example table

Should be unkeyed,must be named db, must contain column FIT. The system will optimize combinations towards the column FIT using the variables allows in the list il

q) db:flip `time`sym`price`var1`var2`var3`var4`FIT!({1000?x}each(12:00:00;(enlist `KX);100;10;10;10;5.0;100?(-1*(100?10)),(50?10)))
q) il:`var1`var2`var3`var4

This system will use combinations of intervals to optimize (sum) of FIT. You can see that each technique is simple- and uses the same peach enabled calculation.

Practical Use:

Flag good trades as true (FIT).
Add a ton of variables
Find combination of variables to get the make good trades.
Better would be to have FIT as profit if position was taken

OR

NBBO
Flag FIT an not inside
add a ton a variables describing that moment
Find combinations that should yield outside trades.

Limits:
 Will use some RAM, db size is not an issue. Pops and buckets set time. 300 variables is no problem. 

Problems:
 This is an example application- as such you can see it converges quickly.
